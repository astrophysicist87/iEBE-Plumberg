#  This small script is used to add additional particle information into the database after the full ebe calculations are done.
#  In order to use this script, one needs to create a /workplace folder in iebe/ directory and copy iSS and EbeCollector into 
#  this folder. In the iSS, user should modify EOS/chosen_particles.dat to choose a list of the particles that he is interested
#  in and want to be collected to the final database. Users should also modify EbeCollector accordingly to collect additional 
#  species of particles. In the end of this script, it will replace the original database and zip files in the RESULTS folder.
